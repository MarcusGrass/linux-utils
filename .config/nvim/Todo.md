# Todo

## General

General necessary fixes

### Sneak

- [ ] Underscore searches doesn't work, cancels search, check settings

## Fuzzy search sources

Probably some LSP integration, in the `Rust` case I need to know where Cargo stores the specific sources for a given project and fuzzy-search in there,
I would like to NvimTree the sources

## Diffview

- [x] open specific file with <C-ENTER> or similar, currently <C-w>gf


## Telescope

- [x] Find files not working at some depth
- [ ] treesitter on diff buffers on custom differ

## Lsp

- [ ] Figure out how to go to inline type-hint definitions


## Additions

### JQ

- [ ] Add JQ formatting with vim.notify on errors formatting
